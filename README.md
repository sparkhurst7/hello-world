Just decided to sign up for GitHub after seeing it in the URL of a Codecademy forum poster. I want to line up resources that will help me as I progress in JavaScript and other coding. 

My discovery of GitHub was the result of an attempt to troubleshoot an issue in my most recent Codecademy "Introduction to JavaScript" lesson (Browser Compability...Transpilation), Exercise 7: Install Node Packages. I installed Node.js and attempted to run npm init but didn't get the interactive form; instead, a description of how the form works...trying to resolve this issue so I can proceed through the exercises in this lesson.
